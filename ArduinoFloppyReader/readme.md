# What is it?
It is a Qt Gui to the AVR Floppy Disk Reader. It's not a writer (for now ;-)

# Credits
Thanks to Robert Smith <rob@robsmithdev.co.uk> for his initial support and some images of the Windows version
Thanks to John Tsiombikas <nuclear@member.fsf.org> for AVR porting instead of Arduino
Thanks to Qt Library to be (almost) cross platform. ;-)
